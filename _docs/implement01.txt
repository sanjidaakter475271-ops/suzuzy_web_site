RoyalConsortium Development Timeline
User Review Required
IMPORTANT

Design Aesthetic Decision Required: Based on the skill rules, we need to choose a BOLD aesthetic direction. I recommend:

Direction: "Luxury Automotive Dark Mode" - Sleek dark theme with metallic gold/champagne accents, reminiscent of premium automotive brands
Typography: Playfair Display (display) + DM Sans (body) - elegant, refined feel
Color Palette: Deep charcoal (#0D0D0F), Champagne Gold (#D4AF37), Pearl White (#F8F8F8), Racing Red (#DC2626) for CTAs
Alternative directions:

"Neon Racing" - Bold neon colors on dark, aggressive sports aesthetic
"Clean Modern Minimal" - Light theme, crisp whites, subtle shadows
"Retro Moto" - Vintage motorcycle aesthetic with sepia tones
CAUTION

Payment Gateway: bKash integration requires Merchant Account approval from bKash. Production credentials needed before launch.
